    <h1>A little Background About Me</h1>
    <p1>Hello my name is Mario Acevedo I was born and raised in San Francisco.

    <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>

    <div style="text-align:center;">

    <p3>I became interested in coding right away and started looking up videos on youtube. I tried learning Ruby Language first but found it too difficult for a beginner. I was advised to start with JavaScript which I did. I often find myself going back to some ruby exercises and now I am able to understand them alot easier. I find code fasinating and look forward to the problem solving and working hard.</p3>
